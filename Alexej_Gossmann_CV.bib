  abstract = "Reducing the number of false positive discoveries is presently
              one of the most pressing issues in the life sciences. It is of
              especially great importance for many applications in neuroimaging
              and genomics, where datasets are typically high-dimensional,
              which means that the number of explanatory variables exceeds the
              sample size. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that
              can be employed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great
              popularity as a tool for testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical
              correlation analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique that is
              used to make sense of the cross-correlation of two sets of
              measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain
              imaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients),
              and sparse CCA extends the classical method to high-dimensional
              settings. Here we propose a way of applying the FDR concept to
              sparse CCA, and a method to control the FDR. The proposed FDR
              correction directly influences the sparsity of the solution,
              adapting it to the unknown true sparsity level. Theoretical
              derivation as well as simulation studies show that our procedure
              indeed keeps the FDR of the canonical vectors below a
              user-specified target level. We apply the proposed method to an
              imaging genomics dataset from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
              Cohort. Our results link the brain connectivity profiles derived
              from brain activity during an emotion identification task, as
              measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to the
              corresponding subjects' genomic data.",

  title={Unified tests for fine scale mapping and identifying sparse high-dimensional sequence associations},
  author={Cao, Shaolong and Qin, Huaizhen and Gossmann, Alexej and Deng, Hong-Wen and Wang, Yu-Ping},
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: In searching for genetic variants for complex
              diseases with deep sequencing data, genomic marker sets of
              high-dimensional genotypic data and sparse functional variants
              are quite common. Existing sequence association tests are
              incapable of identifying such marker sets or individual causal
              loci, although they appeared powerful to identify small marker
              sets with dense functional variants. In sequence association
              studies of admixed individuals, cryptic relatedness and
              population structure are known to confound the association
              analyses. METHOD: We here propose a unified marker wise test
              (uFineMap) to accurately localize causal loci and a unified
              high-dimensional set based test (uHDSet) to identify
              high-dimensional sparse associations in deep sequencing genomic
              data of multi-ethnic individuals with random relatedness. These
              two novel tests are based on scaled sparse linear mixed
              regressions with Lp (0 < p < 1) norm regularization. They jointly
              adjust for cryptic relatedness, population structure and other
              confounders to prevent false discoveries and improve statistical
              power for identifying promising individual markers and marker
              sets that harbor functional genetic variants of a complex trait.
              RESULTS: With large scale simulation data and real data analyses,
              the proposed tests appropriately controlled Type I error rates
              and appeared to be more powerful than several prominent methods.
              We illustrated their practical utilities by the applications to
              DNA sequence data of Framingham Heart Study for osteoporosis. The
              proposed tests identified 11 novel significant genes that were
              missed by the prominent famSKAT and GEMMA. In particular, four
              out of six most significant pathways identified by the uHDSet but
              missed by famSKAT have been reported to be related to BMD or
              osteoporosis in the literature. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
