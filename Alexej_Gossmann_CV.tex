    \item \verb!grpSLOPE! -- Group SLOPE (Group Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation) is a penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-dimensional linear model. Group SLOPE can control the (group) false discovery rate at a user-specified level. Project repository: \url{https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPE}. CRAN: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grpSLOPE/index.html}.
    \item \verb!grpSLOPEMC! -- This is an extension package to the R package grpSLOPE. It contains Monte Carlo based methods for the estimation of the regularizing sequence. Project repository: \url{https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPEMC}.
