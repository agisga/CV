\section{EXPERIENCE}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research assistantship in \emph{The Multiscale Bioimaging and Bioinformatics Laboratory} at Tulane University under the supervision of {Dr.\,Yu-Ping Wang}, resulting six peer-reviewed publications \cite{gossmann2015, cao2015BCB, cao2015bioinformatics, Gossmann2017-yu, brzyski2016, Gossmann2017-ln}, a number of presentations at conferences and workshops, and several open source software packages which have been successfully applied for the analysis of genomics and neuroimaging data. Spring 2015 -- present.
  \item Student Intern doing \emph{machine learning research} in the \emph{Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and Software Reliability} (CDRH/OSEL/DIDSR) at the U.S. \emph{Food \& Drug Administration} (FDA), resulting in a conference presentation and publication \cite{gossmann2018} that can inform future policy on evaluation of machine learning systems in medicine. May -- August 2017 and Jan -- Feb 2018.
  \item Analysis of bone growth data using mixed-effects smoothing spline ANOVA methods (MS project supervised by Dr. Michelle Lacey at Tulane University), resulting in a peer-reviewed publication \cite{sammarco2015}. September 2013 -- May 2014.
  \item Student developer for Google Summer of Code 2015. Project: \emph{Adding Linear Mixed Effects Models Support to SciRuby} (supervised by developers from the Ruby Science Foundation). Summary of accomplishments: \url{http://sciruby.com/blog/2015/08/19/gsoc-2015-mixed-models/}. The created statistical software package received about 2700 downloads, and was considered for deployment at \url{http://www.genenetwork.org}. May -- August 2015.
  \item Mentor for Google Summer of Code 2016 (with the Ruby Science Foundation). Project: \emph{Categorical data support for Daru, Statsample and Statsample-glm}. The mentored student (Lokesh Sharma) made major improvements to several open source software packages for data analysis in Ruby (summary of accomplishments: \url{http://sciruby.com/blog/2016/11/25/gsoc-2016-adding-categorical-data-support/}}). May -- August 2016.
  \item Mentor for Google Summer of Code 2017 (with the Ruby Science Foundation). Project: \emph{Creating the fastest math libraries for Ruby by using the GPU through OpenCL and ArrayFire}. Outcome: a software package and multiple conference presentations by the mentored student (Prasun Anand). Summary of accomplishments: \url{http://www.prasunanand.com/arrayfire/cuda/opencl/ruby/2017/08/28/gsoc17-project-report.html}. May -- August 2017.
  \item Research assistantship under the supervision of {Dr.\,Oleksandr Gromenko} at the Department of Mathematics, Tulane University, working on \emph{statistical methods for the analysis of spatio-temporal processes}, with application in weather prediction. June -- August 2014.
  \item \emph{Instructor, co-teacher, and teaching assistant} for various undergraduate statistics, calculus, and real analysis courses at Tulane University and Technische Universit\"{a}t Darmstadt, Fall 2010 - Fall 2014.

\section{SOFTWARE}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
    \item \verb!grpSLOPE! -- Group SLOPE (Group Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation) is a penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-dimensional linear model. The Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false discovery rate at a user-specified level. Project repository: \url{https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPE}. CRAN: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grpSLOPE/index.html}.
    \item \verb!grpSLOPEMC! -- This is an extension package to the R package grpSLOPE. It contains Monte Carlo based methods for the estimation of the regularizing sequence. Project repository: \url{https://github.com/agisga/grpSLOPEMC}.
    \item \verb!mixed_models! -- Fit statistical linear models with fixed and random effects in Ruby. Project repository: \url{https://github.com/agisga/mixed_models}. RubyGems: \url{https://rubygems.org/gems/mixed_models}.
    \item In my free time I like to contribute to open source software projects. Visit my Github page for the projects that I contribute to: \url{https://github.com/agisga}.
